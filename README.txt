10:44 I have started assignment upon Soaps.

	  I have created a web app which name is Soaps.

	  I created Soaps.cs page.

	  I included seven properties over there.

11:00 I thought I'm missing something, and I found that
	  it was readme file. 

	  I created it.

11:17 I have created database context MvcSoapContext.cs file.

	 I executed provided content in that file.

	 Updated Startup.cs file by Using statements
	 and add provided code to Startup.ConfigureServices.

	 Also updated json file by adding connencting string.

11:31 First I used scaffold tool in order to create 
	 CRUD pages for the soaps modle.

	 But I was unable to do it. I have passed almost 1.5 hours to solve it.

	 Now my scaffolding is working and its time of migration.
	 
	 Then used the EF Core Migrations feature to create the database.

	 again i was not able to migrate and confused but after so many error and tries i did it.


2:40 I wrote everything on readme file.

	 and started testing.

	 It was worked.!!!!!!!


3:15 I created SeedData.cs Class
	 into Models folder.....

	 I insert 10 records of Soaps with diferent properties.

	 They, I updated Program.cs file in order to make SeedData
	 working..... :)

3:20 I finally tried to run program...

	ohhhhh there was some eroor and it was in program.cs

4.00 I found the error. 
h
	 I forgot to include some code, now I have
	 added it....
	at the end it worked.
	 My code is working...

4.15 Now i have mentioned everithing in Readme file.

4:35 I have updated soaps.cs file with controller mathods
	 and view by provided code.

4:45 Now I reached at search menu.

	 That's why I have updated index method three times 
	 in soapsController.cs file.

5.00 I started adding search soaps by type.

	 I built class SoapsTypeViewModel.cs in Modles folder.



6.00 Replace the Index method 
	 in MoviesController.cs with provided code.

	 I forgot to update Index.cshtml file and 
	 I directly tried to run the code.

	 Then I find out it won't work
	 without that file.

6.30 Update Index.cshtml found in Views/Movies/ as
	 given code.
	 h
	 Then I was curious to see my output.
	 awwwwwww!!!!!!

	 It worked.
	 and it says when your code works,
	 don't touch it.

6.45 I was feeling so good after dinner that I didn't think the assignment would go any faster.

	 I've added the Rating field to all pages that require it.

	 Then I check my work.
	 It worked.

7.15 I've added some validation to the Rating field, which requires a value between 1 and 5.
	completed in readme page.


7.30 I have made About us page on home ditrctory.

	 I have tried to link it with navigation bar, so I made changes
	 to the _Layout.cshtml file.


7.55 I realise after 15 minutes that I forgot to update my controller page. 
Now that I've updated it and tried to run it, it works flawlessly. :)

8.15 I checed it again after updating that code.
		
	 It worked properly..... :)
